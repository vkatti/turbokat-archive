This is the first of many deep-dive blogs I intend to write over the
course of few months. I will cover some common (and not-so-common)
functions from various R and Python packages. I choose those functions
that deal with basic user actions like reading/writing files, some
common data wrangling and possibly some visualizations.

Some of you may say that there is enough documentation available online,
why do we need this? I feel that while R, and to some extent Python,
does have enough documentation, we get only code examples. Only in
vignettes do we see the code outputs but when you have functions dealing
with external files/systems, rarely do you get any views or screenshots
of these external entities. My selective laziness prevents me from
running the code examples in the documentation but pushes me to write
blogs about inadequate documentation!

> **If you show code anywhere, you must show its output along with it.**

The second thought is slightly more selfish. I am a victim of *Scope
Creep*\* in my previous blogs and it took ages to finish each one of
them. This will prevent that to some extent. I must confess that this
will push me to write consistently and not run out of material soon.
Wish me luck! I definitely need it.

\*Scope creep in project management refers to changes, continuous or
uncontrolled growth in a project's scope, at any point after the project
begins. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly
defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered harmful.
