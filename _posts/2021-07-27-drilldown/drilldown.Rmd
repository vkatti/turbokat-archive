We often come across denormalized data that has 2 or more levels of information. For example, top-level info like course info with data fields like course id, course name, description, start/end date and second-level info like student info with data fields like with student id, student name, age and gender. We may also have these two groups of data as separate tables with a primary-key foreign-key design, usually from a well-designed SQL database.

Let us create some data.

## Top-Level data: **course**


```{r}
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(rmarkdown, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

course <- tibble(course_id           = 1:4,
                 course_name         = paste("Course", LETTERS[1:4]),
                 start_date          = seq.Date(from = lubridate::as_date("2021-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 4),
                 end_date            = lubridate::ceiling_date(start_date, unit = "month") - 1)

paged_table(course)
```

## Second Level Data: **student**

```{r}
set.seed(42)
student <- tibble(s_id      = 1:20,
                  s_name    = paste("Student", LETTERS[1:20]),
                  gender    = sample(c("X","Y","Z"), 20, replace = TRUE),
                  age       = sample(18:35, 20, replace = TRUE),
                  course_id = sample(1:4, 20, replace = TRUE))

paged_table(student)
```

If we are sourcing data from a database, it is probable that you would see these 2 levels of data in 2 separate tables/views, but most business users are comfortable with MS Excel and want **all the data in one sheet**!!

So the data actually looks something like this.

```{r}
combined_df <- left_join(course, student, by = "course_id")

paged_table(combined_df)
```

Displaying such data in a table causes all the top-level data fields to repeat for every second-level record. You can see that `course_id`, `course_name`, `start_date` and `end_date` columns repeat for all students who enrolled in the same course.  Take a moment to think about how would you display such data in an interactive table in a web page, HTML report or Shiny app. 

It is advisable to split such denormalized data into normalized data i.e. create the original top-level and second level tables from the `combined_df`.

## Vanilla `reactable`

One of my favorite R packages is `{reactable}`. The default output creates a neat interactive table with pagination (if data has more than 10 rows) and ability to sort columns.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
library(reactable, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

reactable(data = combined_df)
```



## Basic Formatting

With some additional tweaks, we can make it look better.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
reactable(
  data       = combined_df,
  compact    = TRUE, # for minimum row height
  filterable = TRUE, # for individual column filters
  striped    = TRUE, # banded rows
  resizable  = TRUE, # for resizable column widths
  columns    = list( # define custom header name, width, alignment etc.
    course_id   = colDef(name = "CID",         width = 50,  align = "center"),
    course_name = colDef(name = "Course Name", width = 140),
    start_date  = colDef(name = "Start Date",  width = 120, align = "center"),
    end_date    = colDef(name = "End Date",    width = 120, align = "center"),
    s_id        = colDef(name = "SID",         width = 70,  align = "center"),
    s_name      = colDef(name = "Student Name"),
    gender      = colDef(name = "Gender",      width = 80,  align = "center"),
    age         = colDef(name = "Age",         width = 50)
  )
)
```

However, the problem of repeating top-level fields still persists. 


## Grouping and Aggregating  


`{reactable}` has a **groupBy** argument which lets us combined rows with common data fields and the **aggregate** argument inside `colDef` lets us define what aggregation to be used for each column of the top-level data.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
reactable(
  data       = combined_df,
  compact    = TRUE, # for minimum row height
  filterable = TRUE, # for individual column filters
  striped    = TRUE, # banded rows
  resizable  = TRUE, # for resizable column widths
  groupBy    = "course_id",
  columns    = list(
    # show count of students in each course
    course_id   = colDef(name = "CID",         width = 100,  align = "left",    aggregate = "count"),  
    # show unique course name
    course_name = colDef(name = "Course Name", width = 140,                     aggregate = "unique"), 
    # show unique start date
    start_date  = colDef(name = "Start Date",  width = 120,  align = "center",  aggregate = "unique"), 
    # show unique end date
    end_date    = colDef(name = "End Date",    width = 120,  align = "center",  aggregate = "unique"), 
    s_id        = colDef(name = "SID",         width = 70,   align = "center"),
    s_name      = colDef(name = "Student Name"),
    gender      = colDef(name = "Gender",      width = 80,   align = "center"),
    age         = colDef(name = "Age",         width = 50)
  )
)
```

In this case, all the columns which are not `aggregate`d remain hidden. Clicking the little triangle in the `CID` column displays the hidden rows. Looks better, but again, the issue of duplicated data remains.


You can aggregate the second-level columns too, but this distorts the table and frankly, looks ugly. Here I aggregate the `SID` column in addition to all the other top-level columns.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
reactable(
  data       = combined_df,
  compact    = TRUE, # for minimum row height
  filterable = TRUE, # for individual column filters
  striped    = TRUE, # banded rows
  resizable  = TRUE, # for resizable column widths
  groupBy    = "course_id",
  columns    = list(
    course_id   = colDef(name = "CID",         width = 100,  align = "left",    aggregate = "count"),
    course_name = colDef(name = "Course Name", width = 140,                     aggregate = "unique"),
    start_date  = colDef(name = "Start Date",  width = 120,  align = "center",  aggregate = "unique"),
    end_date    = colDef(name = "End Date",    width = 120,  align = "center",  aggregate = "unique"),
    # YIKES!! Aggregating Student ID to show unique ids in each course.
    s_id        = colDef(name = "SID",         width = 70,   align = "center",  aggregate = "unique"), 
    s_name      = colDef(name = "Student Name"),
    gender      = colDef(name = "Gender",      width = 80,   align = "center"),
    age         = colDef(name = "Age",         width = 50)
  )
)
```



Wouldn't it be nice if we could display only the top-level columns by default and on clicking the small triangle for a row, show all the second-level columns corresponding to that row only, like a drill-down table?


To do this we need 2 separate tables. Earlier in this post, I said it is advisable to split such denormalized data into normalized data i.e. create the original top-level and second level tables from the `combined_df`. Let's recreate the 2 tables.  

I want to demonstrate how we go from the combined data to the 2 tables. Hence I will not use the `course` and `student` tables created earlier.  

Creating the `top_level` table using just the columns in `course`. Let's also create a new column `n_students` depicting count of students in each course.

```{r}
top_level <- combined_df %>% 
  # Only course info columns
  count(course_id, course_name, start_date, end_date, name = "n_students") 

paged_table(top_level)
```

```{r}
second_level <- combined_df %>% 
  # Only Student info columns with unique identifier for Course
  select(course_id, s_id, s_name, gender, age) %>% 
  arrange(s_id)

paged_table(second_level)
```


## The final Drill-down Table  

Now that we have the 2 tables ready, let us now create the final `{reactable}`. The trick here is to use the **details** argument to which we pass another `{reactable}` of just the rows with students data corresponding to given course.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
reactable(
  data       = top_level,
  compact    = TRUE, # for minimum row height
  filterable = TRUE, # for individual column filters
  striped    = TRUE, # banded rows
  resizable  = TRUE, # for resizable column widths
  columns    = list(
    course_id   = colDef(name = "CID",             width = 50,  align = "center"),
    course_name = colDef(name = "Course Name"), 
    start_date  = colDef(name = "Start Date",      width = 120, align = "center"),
    end_date    = colDef(name = "End Date",        width = 120, align = "center"),
    n_students  = colDef(name = "No. of Students", width = 130, align = "center")
  ),
  details = function(index) { # index is the row number of current row.
    # sub-table of only those students for current row.
    sec_lvl = second_level[second_level$course_id == top_level$course_id[index], ] 
    reactable(data       = sec_lvl,
              compact    = TRUE, 
              filterable = TRUE,
              bordered   = TRUE, 
              resizable  = TRUE,
              columns    = list(
                course_id   = colDef(show = FALSE), # hide the course id column
                s_id        = colDef(name = "SID",    width = 70, align = "center"),
                s_name      = colDef(name = "Student Name"),
                gender      = colDef(name = "Gender", width = 90, align = "center"),
                age         = colDef(name = "Age",    width = 50, align = "center")
              )
              )
  }
)
```

Since the sub-table is also a `{reactable}`, you can go another level down... and another, but please do consider the usability aspect of this feature before taking that decision. I haven't  tried going beyond 2 levels of data myself. Maybe a part 2 to this post??


## Conclusion

Drill-down tables let you pack a lot of data in a compact manner and allow use by multiple audiences interested in varying degrees/levels of information. `{reactable}` can help create an interactive data table from tabular data with sorting and pagination by default. The data table is an HTML widget that can be used in R Markdown documents and Shiny applications, or viewed from an R console. A lot of features can be enabled/disabled using the basic arguments of the `reactable()` function and much more using custom JavaScript.
