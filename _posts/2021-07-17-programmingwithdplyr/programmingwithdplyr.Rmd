# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to act as a quick guide for myself and others to understand how to use `dplyr` effectively to create dynamic functions. The general assumption is that the reader is familiar with the `{dplyr}` package and how to use it for data wrangling.

In this document, we will explore how to create functions using the popular `dplyr` verbs like `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange` and finally `group_by` with `summarise`.

### Inspiration

I regularly deal with event-related information with event date and few other columns like event type, root cause etc. Most reports usually involve calculating number of events that took place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, sometimes split by event type, root cause and other columns. After a few reports I realized that I am basically writing the same code over and over again to calculate these KPIs. Keeping the `DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)` principle in mind, I managed to write a few functions to calculate these KPIs with a few dynamic variables. Following is an attempt to articulate what I learnt while creating those functions.

### Data

We shall use the Texas Housing Sales data, available as a tibble in the popular `ggplot2` package as reference data. It contains monthly information about the housing market in Texas provided by the TAMU real estate center, <https://www.recenter.tamu.edu/>. It has 8602 observations and 9 variables.

```{r}
txhousing <- ggplot2::txhousing
dplyr::glimpse(txhousing)
```

We shall refer the above data in all the following sections.

# `select()`

When using `dplyr` functions, the two most popular ways to pass column names is either as bare names i.e. column names without enclosing them in quotes like `sales` or `volume` OR pass them as a character string like "sales" or 'volume'. You could also pass a character vector like `c("sales", "volume")`. In this section we will explore the 3 ways to dynamically select the columns we want.

### Passing raw column names

In this method, we pass the raw name of the column we want to select and use the `embrace` of curly-curly brackets to pass the raw name. For multiple columns, we can pass the raw names as a single vector.

```{r select_raw}
select_raw <- function(df, var) {
  dplyr::select(.data = df, {{var}}) %>%     # embrace of curly-curly {{}} brackets
    head()                                   # to limit the number of output rows in this example.
}
select_raw(txhousing, sales)                 # pass single raw name
select_raw(txhousing, c(sales, volume))      # pass a vector of raw names for multiple columns
```

If passing multiple raw names as vector as in the `select_raw()` feels like an unnecessary complication, try the next method.

### Passing multiple raw column names using ... argument

In this method, we use the `.` argument to pass the raw names of the columns we want to select.

```{r my_select}
my_select <- function(df, ...) {
  dplyr::select(.data = df, ...) %>% 
    head()
}

my_select(txhousing, sales, volume)          # pass multiple raw names directly
```

### Passing a character vector of column names

If we have the column names as a character vector, we use the `all_of` function to pass the character vector to the internal `select` function.

```{r my_select_char}
my_select_char <- function(df, cols) {
  dplyr::select(.data = df, dplyr::all_of(cols)) %>% 
    head()
}

my_cols <- c("sales","volume")
my_select_char(txhousing, my_cols)
```

# `filter()`

In the previous section, we passed column names either as bare names or character strings. `filter()` takes one or more expressions/conditions that result in a logical vector, with same length as number of rows in the data.frame/tibble and returns only those rows for which the expression/condition returns `TRUE`. Following are 2 ways to pass these logical expressions/conditions. I'm using expression and condition interchangeably here. In this context, a condition is an expression that results in a boolean `TRUE/FALSE` result.

### Passing single raw criteria

In this method, we pass the condition `sales > 8000` as a raw/bare expression.

```{r filter_raw}
filter_raw <- function(df, cond) {
  dplyr::filter(.data = df, {{cond}})        # embrace of curly-curly {{}} brackets
}

filter_raw(txhousing, sales > 8000)          # Pass a single raw criterion

```

Do you think we can pass multiple bare conditions as a vector, like we did for `select_raw()` in the previous section? Let us try passing multiple raw criteria as a vector.

```{r error=TRUE}
filter_raw(txhousing, c(sales > 8000, year > 2010))
```

Passing multiple raw criteria as a vector doesn't work like it works for `select_raw()` function. Let us understand why. Consider the following code:

```{r}
A <- c(TRUE, TRUE)                           # boolean vector of length = 2
B <- c(FALSE, FALSE)                         # boolean vector of length = 2
X <- c(A, B)
X
```

Notice that length of X is 4. Similarly, `sales > 8000` evaluates to a TRUE/FALSE boolean vector of length 8602 (equal to number of rows in `txhousing`) and so does `year > 2010`. So the vector `c(sales > 8000, year > 2010)` becomes a TRUE/FALSE boolean vector of length 17204, which results in an error.

### Passing multiple raw criteria using ... argument

To pass multiple raw criteria, we can use the `...` argument.

```{r my_filter}
my_filter <- function(df, ...) { 
  dplyr::filter(.data = df, ...)                # pass the dots argument
  }

my_filter(txhousing, sales > 8000, year > 2010) # pass multiple raw criteria
```

### Passing single criteria as a character string

By default, `dplyr::filter()` does not accept conditions as character strings. Following is an example which results in error

```{r error=TRUE}
dplyr::filter(txhousing, "sales > 8000")
```

We need to convert the character condition into a raw expression.

```{r my_filter_string}
my_filter_string <- function(df, cond) {
  dplyr::filter(.data = df, eval(parse(text = cond)))   # convert text to raw criterion
}

my_filter_string(txhousing, "sales > 8000")             # pass single text string as criteria
```

The special sauce here is the `eval(parse(text = ...))` combo that converts the long text criteria into a single raw criteria and passes it to the internal `filter()` function.

### Passing multiple criteria as character vector

What if want to pass multiple criteria as a string vector? In such a situation, we must combine all the string conditions into a single long string condition using `paste0(..., collapse = " & ")`. The `paste0("(", cond, ")", collapse = " & ")` combines all the criteria into a single long criteria, but still a text string.

```{r my_filter_strings}
my_filter_strings <- function(df, cond) { 
  filter_text <- paste0("(", cond, ")", collapse = " & ")   # combine all criteria
  message("Filter Condition: ", filter_text)                # (OPTIONAL) show the combined filter string
  dplyr::filter(.data = df, eval(parse(text = filter_text)))# convert text to raw criterion
  }

my_filter_criteria <- c("sales > 8000", "year > 2010")
my_filter_strings(txhousing, my_filter_criteria)

```

```{r filter_OR}
my_filter_criteria_with_OR <- c("sales > 8000 | sales < 50", "year > 2010")

# NOTE: OR criteria must be a single string separated by pipe '|' as in example below.
my_filter_strings(txhousing, my_filter_criteria_with_OR)
```

# `mutate()`

`mutate()` allows you to add new columns or modify existing columns. In the example below, we will create a new column `volume_in_millions` from the existing column `volume`. The names of both the columns can be passed to the function either as raw names or character strings.

### Passing the column name as raw name

```{r mutate_raw}
mutate_raw <- function(df, new_col_raw, old_col_raw, num = 1) { 
  dplyr::mutate(.data = df, {{new_col_raw}} := {{old_col_raw}}/num) %>% 
    head()
}

txhousing %>% 
  select(city, year, month, volume) %>% 
  mutate_raw(vol_in_millions, volume, 1E6) # pass raw column names w/o quotes
```

### Passing the new variable name as character string (direct)

```{r mutate_text}
mutate_text <- function(df, new_col_str, old_col_str, num = 1) { 
  dplyr::mutate(.data = df, {{new_col_str}} := df[[old_col_str]]/num) %>% 
    head()
}

txhousing %>% 
  select(city, year, month, volume) %>%
  mutate_text("vol_in_millions", "volume", 1E6) # pass column names as strings

```

### Passing the new variable name as character string (indirect)

Instead of passing the name of the variable as a character string as an argument, we can pass a variable containing the name of the variable. In the below example, the name of the new variable is stored in `new_var`. Using the new `{glue}` syntax, enabled by the walrus operator `:=`, we substitute the `new_var` variable with its value.

```{r mutate_var}

mutate_var <- function(df, new_col_var, old_col_var, num = 1) {
  dplyr::mutate(.data = df, "{new_col_var}" := df[[old_col_var]]/num) %>% 
    head()
}

new_var <- "vol_in_millions"
old_var <- "volume"

txhousing %>% 
  select(city, year, month, volume) %>%
  mutate_var(new_var, old_var, 1E6)  # pass column names as variables
```

# `arrange()`

`arrange()` sorts the rows of a data frame by the values of selected columns. By default, it sorts in Ascending order. To force a column to sort in Descending order, we must use the `desc()` function.

### Passing single raw name

```{r arrange_raw}
arrange_raw <- function(df, var) {
  dplyr::arrange(.data = df, {{var}}) %>%    # embrace of curly-curly {{}} brackets
    head()
}

arrange_raw(txhousing, sales)
arrange_raw(txhousing, desc(sales))
```

`arrange_raw()` fails when we pass multiple raw names as a vector.

```{r error=TRUE}
arrange_raw(txhousing, c(sales, volume))
```

### Passing multiple raw names using `...` argument

To pass multiple raw names, we must use the `...` argument.

```{r arrange_raw_multiple}
arrange_raw_multiple <- function(df, ...) {
  dplyr::arrange(.data = df, ...) %>% 
    head()
}

arrange_raw_multiple(txhousing, city, sales)
arrange_raw_multiple(txhousing, city, desc(sales))
```

### Pass single column name as string

```{r arrange_str}
arrange_str <- function(df, var, .desc = FALSE) {
  if (.desc) {
    dplyr::arrange(.data = df, desc(df[[var]])) %>% head()
  } else {
    dplyr::arrange(.data = df, df[[var]]) %>% head()
  }
}

arrange_str(txhousing, "sales")
arrange_str(txhousing, "sales", .desc = TRUE)
```

### Pass multiple column name as string

```{r arrange_str_multiple}
arrange_str_multiple <- function(df, var, desc = FALSE) {
  if (desc) {
    dplyr::arrange(.data = df, desc(df[var])) %>% head()
  } else {
    dplyr::arrange(.data = df, df[var]) %>% head()
  }
}

# This function arranges the dataframe either all ascending
# or all descending. Definitely need a better example.

arrange_str_multiple(txhousing, c("year", "month", "sales"))
arrange_str_multiple(txhousing, c("year", "month", "sales"), desc = TRUE)
```

# `group_by()`

In `group_by()`, we *select* which columns to, well, group by! (Damn these well-named functions!). So one can use the same techniques as `select()` to choose the columns.

In the following examples, we will create only one summarised value `total_sales` for simplicity.

### Passing single raw name

```{r group_raw}
group_raw <- function(df, grp) {
  df %>% 
    group_by({{grp}}) %>% 
    summarise(total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm = TRUE),
              .groups = 'drop')  %>% 
    head(n=5)
}

group_raw(txhousing, year)        # Sum of sales per year
group_raw(txhousing, month)       # Sum of sales per month
```

### Passing multiple raw names using the `...` operator

```{r group_raw_multiple}
group_raw_multiple <- function(df, ...) {
  df %>% 
    group_by(...) %>% 
    summarise(total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm = TRUE),
              .groups = 'drop')  %>% 
    head(n = 5)
}

group_raw_multiple(txhousing, year)              # Sum of sales per year
group_raw_multiple(txhousing, year, month)       # Sum of sales per month
```

### Passing single or multiple column names as character string

```{r group_str}
group_str <- function(df, grp) {
  df %>% 
    group_by(df[grp]) %>% 
    summarise(total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm = TRUE),
              .groups = 'drop')  %>% 
    head(n=5)
}

group_str(txhousing, "year")                   # Sum of sales per year
group_str(txhousing, c("year", "month"))       # Sum of sales per month


# The same column names can be passed as variables containing the character names
yr <- "year"
group_str(txhousing, yr)


yrmon <- c("year", "month")
group_str(txhousing, yrmon)

```

If you want the summarise column to have a custom name like `total_<sumvar>`, then you can wrap the value in quotes as below. This method uses the `glue` syntax enabled by the `:=` walrus operator. The walrus operator takes either a raw name or a character string on its LHS.

```{r group_raw2}
group_raw2 <- function(df, grp, sumvar) {
  df %>% 
    group_by({{grp}}) %>% 
    summarise("total_{{sumvar}}" := sum({{sumvar}}, na.rm = TRUE),
              .groups = 'drop')  %>% 
    head(n=5)
}

group_raw2(txhousing, year, sales)            # Sum of sales per year
group_raw2(txhousing, month, listings)        # Sum of listings per month
```

After writing so many examples, I see a pattern. `group_by()` works with techniques similar to `select()` while `summarise()` works with techniques similar to `mutate()`.

# (Slightly Better) Examples

The `txhousing` is a city-wise monthly sales and volume dataset. It has a `year` and `month` column. Let us create a `date` column and keep only those columns relevant for our custom `tx_summary()` function.

```{r small_df}
small_df <- txhousing %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::as_date(glue::glue("{year}-{month}-01"))) %>% 
  select(city, date, sales, volume)
           
```

### `mutate()` example

Now let us create the `create_ymq()` function. This function would take 2 arguments, a data frame `df` and a raw name of a date column.

```{r create_ymq}
create_ymq <- function(df, date_col) {
  stopifnot(inherits(df, "data.frame"))
  stopifnot(class(df %>% dplyr::pull({{date_col}})) == 'Date')
  dplyr::mutate(df,
                Year = lubridate::year({{date_col}}),
                nHalf = lubridate::semester({{date_col}}),
                yHalf = lubridate::semester({{date_col}}, with_year = TRUE),
                dHalf = paste0(lubridate::semester({{date_col}}), "H", format({{date_col}},"%y")),
                nQtr = lubridate::quarter({{date_col}}),
                yQtr = lubridate::quarter({{date_col}}, with_year = TRUE),
                dQtr = paste0(lubridate::quarter({{date_col}}),"Q", format({{date_col}},"%y")),
                Month = lubridate::month({{date_col}}),
                yMonth = as.numeric(format({{date_col}}, "%Y.%m")),
                dMonth = format({{date_col}}, "%b %Y")
                )
}

create_ymq(df = small_df, date_col = date) %>% glimpse()
```

### `group_by()` example

Now that we have a function that creates various date-related columns, let us create a function that let's you create summary tables like annual sales per city, quarterly volumes per city etc.

```{r}
tx_summary <- function(df, grp_col, sum_col) {
  df %>% 
    group_by(city, {{grp_col}}) %>% 
    summarise("total_{{sum_col}}" := sum({{sum_col}}, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
}
```

Using these 2 functions, we can now create multiple summary tables

```{r}
small_df_with_date_cols <- small_df %>% create_ymq(date_col = date)

# Annual Sales per city
small_df_with_date_cols %>% tx_summary(grp_col = Year, sum_col = sales)

# Half Yearly volumes per city
small_df_with_date_cols %>% tx_summary(grp_col = yHalf, sum_col = volume)

# Quarterly Sales per city
small_df_with_date_cols %>% tx_summary(grp_col = yQtr, sum_col = sales)

# Monthly Volumes per city
small_df_with_date_cols %>% tx_summary(grp_col = yMonth, sum_col = volume)
```

### More ideas

You could further extend this by creating a custom filtering function that gives you, say, the rows with the highest or lowest `total_sales` or `total_volume`.

# Conclusion

The ability to create such dynamic functions, enabled by the wonderful {dplyr} package, allows us to level-up in terms of programming with R and helps make our code neat and tidy.
