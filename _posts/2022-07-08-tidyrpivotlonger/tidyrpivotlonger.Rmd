# Intro

One of the primary data manipulation operations is pivoting your tabular from "wide" format to "long" format and vice-versa. The idea is to make your tabular data "tidy" i.e.

* Every column is a variable. 
* Every row is an observation. 
* Every cell is a single value. 

Interestingly, this "tidy" format is also the "long" format which is desirable for data and plotting operations using R, Python or other data processing programming languages. The {tidyr} R package has pivot_* functions that allow you to do so.
